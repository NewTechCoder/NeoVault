# Step 1: Define Your Project

- Objective: Build a Simple Banking Application that includes user account management, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history.

- Tech Stack: Java for development, GitHub for version control, and Jira for project management.

# Step 2: Gather Requirements

## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to create a new bank account so that I can start using banking services.

- As a user, I want to deposit money into my account so that I can increase my balance.

- As a user, I want to withdraw money from my account so that I can access my funds.

- As a user, I want to check my account balance so that I know how much money I have.

- As a user, I want to view my transaction history so that I can track my spending.

- Acceptance Criteria: Define clear success criteria for each user story.

# Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

## Install Tools:

- Download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) and IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

- Create a GitHub account and set up Git on your machine.

- Install Jira or sign up for a free account.

## Set Up Repositories:

- Create a new GitHub repository for version control.

- Clone it to your local machine.

## Organize Jira:

- Create a Jira project.

- Set up a Kanban or Scrum board (depending on your preference).

# Step 4: Plan Sprints

- Divide your project into 3 sprints, each lasting 1-2 weeks.

## Sprint 1: Foundation

### Tasks:

- Set up a basic Java project structure.

- Implement user authentication and account creation.

- Create a GitHub branch and commit the code regularly.

## Sprint 2: Core Banking Features

### Tasks:

- Implement deposit and withdrawal functionality.

- Add balance checking and transaction recording.

## Sprint 3: Final Touches

### Tasks:

- Design a user-friendly console or GUI interface.

- Perform error handling and edge-case testing.

- Document the project (e.g., README file for GitHub).

## Step 5: Daily Workflow

Start each day with a daily stand-up:

- What did you accomplish yesterday?

- What will you work on today?

- Any blockers or challenges?

Use Jira to update task progress on the board.

## Step 6: Learn and Apply

### For Java:

- Start with basic concepts: OOP, classes, objects, methods, and data structures.

- Progress to file handling (for storing transaction history) and exception handling.

### For GitHub:

- Learn branching, pull requests, and merging.

- Practice collaboration workflows (even solo, simulate team-based Git operations).

### For Jira:

- Practice creating issues, tracking progress, and generating sprint reports.

## Step 7: Testing

- Perform Unit Testing: Write tests for each method in your Java application.

- Conduct Integration Testing: Ensure that different modules work together.

Test the application manually for user stories.

## Step 8: Deploy

- Create a release branch in GitHub.

- Package your application as a .jar file and upload it to the repository.

- Celebrate your achievement!

## Step 9: Retrospective

### Reflect on:

- What went well during the project?

- What could be improved?

- What did you learn about the software development lifecycle?
